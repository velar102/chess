# JavaFX UDP Network Chess

All that is required to run the game is the latest Java JRE installed.

The applet can be launched by running chess/Dist/Chess.jar
You can run multiple copies to test connections with localhost.
All the code is located in the java files in chess/src/Chess

The game was programmed using Netbeans. Netbeans may be installed for easier viewing of the code, but
is not neccessary.

You can host agame by going to Network -> Host in the upper left menu.

You can join a hosted game by going to Network -> Connect in the upper left menu.
You must enter an IP to do so. The default entry, localhost, may be left in the field
for testing purposes to connect two applets on the same computer.
Just hit OK to connect to the entered IP.

If you want to reset the board to the default state at any time, go to Board -> Reset in the upper left menu.

Going to Board -> Reset in the upper left menu will also disconnect from any active connection.
This allows for another connection to a new host or client via the same methods as initially.
